In Yara, both employees and managers take accountability in scheduling regular check-ins to communicate on the progress of goals that have been set at the beginning of the year. It is in our own interest as employees to make ourselves familiar with what is expected of us to align our goals in order to meet Yara's strategy and where to document them for further reference. ",

Navigating changes well should not just be a matter of survival, but instead, these changes present an opportunity for us to hone our adaptability and resilience skills.

Yara's Communities of Practice enable colleagues to exchange knowledge and skills outside of their own teams and location. This gives colleagues access to a wider range of expertise that offers help with a variety of challenges (e.g., technical challenges, site logistics, productivity and business problems) and allow for continuous improvement and more meaningful contributions to your team's goals.Your team also benefits from rapid problem-solving, continuous improvement ideas, and solutions trialled elsewhere in Yara.",
